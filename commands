//Undoing Reverting Resetting code changes:
#To revert the uncommitted changes:
Git checkout — <filename> ==>reverting back the changes for single file

Git checkout —  . =>this will undo the changes in the files

#To revert the committed changes:
Git revert <commitID> This will revert the commit as well commit the revert

I want to revert the commit and explicitely commit after revert:
Git revert -n <commitId> it will revert but will not commit atomically so we need to commit explicitly.

#Resetting changes using git reset:

Git reset —hard <commitId> to revert back to that particular commit(this is powerful command so we should be careful)

#Branches(create Merge Delete  a branch)
-Git branch —>to display the list of branch
-Git branch <branchname> to create the branch
-Git checkout <branchname> => to make the newly created branch active

#Merge Two Branches:
Go to the branch where you want to merge
Git merge <branchname> 

Git push ==> to push the branch in to GitHub

First go to that branch and do git push 

Branch is needed to have two separate copies of the code

Deleting the branch:


Git checkout -b dummy —> create the branch dummy and also checkout that branch at the same time

git branch -d <branchname>

HEAD is a reference to the most recent commit in current branch (in most of the cases)
Git show HEAD
Git show <commitId>  both command display same output
Head is short form of writing this commit id

Git difftool <commidId1> <commitId2>
Or
Git difftool HEAD~2 HEAD~1


When HEAD is not pointing to the most recent commit you go into detached HEAD state
Git checkout <commitID> from which commit you want to proceed from

git checkout master —>you want to come out of the detached HEAD state
